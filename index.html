<h1>HOW I CAME OUT OF CULT AND INTO CHURCH .</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
 I got initiated into cult, Vikings Fraternity, before I secured admission to study Accountancy at the Akanu Ibiam Federal Polytechnic. I became actively involved into it during my second semester in year one. But, something in me was telling me to consider my way. At a point I hated what I was doing, but didn’t know how to come out of it. However, after my OND, I decided to further my education at the Federal Polytechnic, Nekede, Owerri, Imo State. I went to Nekede desiring to create a new beginning. My reason of going to Federal Polytechnic, Nekede, was aborted because the Greater One wasn’t in me. Friends, cultism is a sinker of destiny. After one month in Nekede, I identified with the group again. I later realized that change of location does not equal to creating a new. Any change that does not begin with receiving Jesus into one’s life will amount to nothing. To worsen my case, I was a full time marijuana student at that time. I wasn’t just an addicted hemp smoker, but a “feared dealer.’’ One day I went to a primary school to smoke without knowing that the Police was tasked to arrest hoodlums who were terrorizing that location. That was on a Saturday morning. When I got to the premises, I looked but didn’t see anyone. But all of a sudden an armed police officer showed up from nowhere. This incident happened in my final year. Thanks be to Jesus Who never allowed me to go to hell. The Police officer searched my thoroughly, and found a sachet of hemp in my pocket. I pleaded with him, but he refused. The man insisted of taking me to the police station. On our way to the police station, he tried to bring down his gun which he hung on his shoulder. I pushed him and ran, and the officer brought out his gun and shut directly at me. No single bullet touched. On my way back to school, I saw a man who was holding a book written by Bishop David Abioye of Winners Chapel, “Creating A New Beginning”. The reader was beside me. I saw a statement in that book that started my conversion process. That statement reads, “you cannot continue to do the same thing and expect a different result.” I never heard that kind of word before. Before that, whenever I got back home, I could hear my mother petitioning all of her children to God in prayer. Most of her prayers were centered on salvation of souls for all her children.

        <h3>THE VISITATION THAT NEVER LEFT ME THE SAME</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
When I got to the School, I saw another book somebody was holding by John Maxwell, Attitude 101”. I saw that attitude was rotten. During this period, that was in my second semester final year, I had a very strange visitation. An old man walked into my room while I was asleep around 1am in the morning, and said to me,” stop what you are doing, if not you will end up in miserable.” I opened my eyes, but saw something that looked like a shadow of an old man walking out of my room. The old man’s words started echoing in my ears for days, and days entered month. I will never forget what happened that night. At that time, I never had such visitation before in my life, so I became afraid. Immediately, I started ruminating on my ways. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no cultist that can be won for Christ in the energy of mere advice and counselling. Every cultist entered into a covenant with a demon sealed with blood. So, trying to win them on the arena of sweet words will amount to an effort in futility. After I had that encounter at night, the following day I went out and shared what I saw with some friends. One of them echoed, and said,” please give him one jumbo of marijuana to enable him come back to normal.” I collected the marijuana and did as occasion demanded, only to discover that the appetite was no more in me. Praise the LORD! In the evening of that day, we had a meeting which I attended. One of them looked at my face, and said,”you don’t belong here any longer.” Friends, it was the force of prayer that was at work. I saw what I have lost for involving in cultism.The following morning, for the very first time in my life, in seven years, I requested for a Bible from a friend who knew what I was involved into. He was so shocked that I could ask him for a Bible. Ladies and gentlemen, the Gospel is the power of Salvation. I didn’t give my life to Jesus then, but few months later I got saved. There is nothing good in cultism. Cultism is a sinker of destiny
After graduation, I lost my peace. My life had no meaning. Every morning I would rush down to a particular pit where wheel barrow pushers usually assemble to smoke hemp, and joined them. Friends, cultism is a spirit, and that spirit is the devil. Don’t let that defeated enemy to have the final say. The Lion of the Tribe of Judae has prevailed. Ladies and gentlemen, Jesus is alive. He is coming back again. Let no one take your crown. In case you don’t have any crown, I’m going to show you a way of escape. However, before I do that let me finish my story. One day, I became friend with a man named Festus. At that point I was left alone. My life had no meaning. On a particular day, Festus asked me to follow him to a place to do something. I followed him and found myself in the church. Meanwhile, that day, I had smoked excess hemp was seriously looking for how to eat. I knew fully well that my new found friend must have food to give if stayed till the service ended. To worsen my case, the usher took me to the front row. That church was Winners Chapel, Oyigbo. It was a midweek service. When I sat there, I couldn’t what my eyes saw. I saw a people who were so happy. I even saw some of my old friends who have turned to the Lord in the church. My heart was still boiling. Friends, God can do nothing outside His word. I found out that something began to happen when the pastor began to minister. I will never forget the name of the Pastor who ministered that day. He name was Pastor Prosper. That day, he was speaking on the principle of success. My heart melted when the word of God was preached. It was that day that I gave my life to Jesus.

      <h3>THESE ENCOUNTERS DEFINED MY LIFE</h3>
      <h3>One day, that was December, 2008, exactly two months after
         gave my life to Jesus. I decided to go on a three days fasting.
          Being a new convert my soul was thirsting after God. As a result,
          I chose to go to a quiet place to seek the face of the Lord in prayer.
          The house I was living that time was usually filled with noisy occupants.
        In my quest to know the Lord, I carried my Bible and went to a place
        I could describe as a forest. I went there with a cutlass to enable me
         clear a place I could kneel down and pray. I went there the first day and
         came back successfully. When I got there on the second day, I had worshiped
         and sang praises to the Lord, I sat down on the ground to study God’s word.
         In the process of time, a strange  sleep took over me. Suddenly, it was like
          a hand touched me and woke me up. When awake from the sleep, I had a still
          small that said to “fight.” Immediately, I placed my hand on the ground and
           pray thus, I command every power that came to attack me to scatter,
            in the name of Jesus. Friends, I was just two months old in the Lord.
             The place I was, I couldn’t  look into the forest to see what could be
             lying somewhere beside me. Friends, when I made that prayer, I heard a very
             big movement, and the entire forest was shaking. It was an evil python that
             came to eat me up my flesh.  </h3>
             <h3>DAY THREE CHANGED ME COMPLETELY</h3>
             <h3>After that second day encounter, I was scared to go back there to complete
               the prayer. As I was meditating I heard a still voice
                that said to me, “go I will show you mighty things today.’’
                I summoned courage, and took my Bible, and went as was commanded.
                 When I got to the location, as I sat down to study, the Lord gave me
                 six verses of scriptures: Luke 10 vs 19, Rev 12 vs 11, and Phil 2 vs 9-11.
                  Being someone whom Jesus just delivered from cultism, I never came across
                  with such verses before. But, I was dazed when after reading these verses
                  of scriptures they were stamped on my spirit man. Friends, He is alive!
                   If you need power surrender your life to Jesus. As a drop my Bible and
                    started worshiping the Lord, I had a still small voice that said,
                    “turn back and fight.”  When I turned back, I saw something that
                    I will never forget until I depart from this earth. I don’t think
                     there is any of our meetings where I don’t share this testimony.
                      I will never cease from sharing it. Friends, I saw a very long python,
                       descending towards me, and was  about to strike me. Don’t play with
                       the word of God. The words the Lord gave roared from inside.
                       The first thing I said to that python was, In the name of Jesus
                        Christ of Nazareth, I command you to stop. For it is written,
                        how God has highly exacted Him, and given Him a name which above
                        every other name, and that at the mention of the name of Jesus,
                        every knee must bow, of things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth.
                        I quoted Luke 10 vs 19, and Rev 12 vs 11. I was just a new convert.
                        I shared this testimony to let you know what you are missing when you
                         are not in Christ Jesus. I defeated that python, came out of the forest unhurt.
                          After that incident, I made up my mind to follow completely the Giver of just six verses of His word that humbled a devilish python. What do you think that python saw that made it turned back? The python never saw me. It saw Jesus. It saw how was
                        barricaded with fire. I never saw the invisible physically,
                         but the enemy saw something that drove it back. What I saw was
                          the word. I saw the Word made flesh on the pages of scriptures.
                          I called upon His name in my trouble, He answered me.
                          Jesus still calling someone today by His word, saying,
                           everyone that calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</h3>
              <h3>DELIVERED FROM ACCIDENT</h3>
              <h4>Ladies and gentlemen, never you neglect this great salvation which is
                in Christ. I got saved in October 2008. After wasted years, my name
                eventually came out for Youth Service that same year. I was posted to Adamawa State. In February 2009, I reported to the NYSC orientation camp. After the orientation, I reported to my place of primary assignment, and after was given permission to travel to Port Harcourt in order to prepare adequately before reporting back. I left Adamawa State and arrived Port Harcourt successfully.
However, on Wednesday, May 5th, 2009, a day I will never forget in a hurry, a tragedy
 occurred.
I went to Eleme Junction in Port Harcourt, paid for a seat to go back to Adamawa State.
 The name of the company was Fair Plus. A seat number 5 was given to which was located
  beside the window, and looked so comfortable. However, the seat number four was
  allocated to another lady. As I sat down in the car, the lady with seat number 4
   came to me and pleaded that I should give her seat number 5 and take seat number 4.
    I knew the lady. She finished in Nekede. She was posted to Adamawa State for her
    Youth Service. In fact, the motor was packed with Corp Members. When the lady
     told me, I resisted her because the position I sat was so comfortable. But,
     as the Vehicle was about to depart, I told the driver to hold on. I jumped
     out of the car to check if my travelling properties were in the vehicle.
     At that time, everyone in the car was mad at me because I was wasting their time.
     When I got the vehicle, I found out that my seat number 5 had been occupied by
     the lady beside me who seat number 4 was given. All effort to make her vacate
     the seat for me proved futile. I wanted to react, but the love of God in my
      heart constrained me. I left sat at her original position which actually made
      me so uncomfortable because of my heart. When all these were going on, I never
       knew that there was a divine replacement going in the spirit. When we got to
       Taraba State, the driver said he would like to watch Chelsea vs Barcelona.
       The driver was in a very high speed, and ran into a moving truck. Friends,
       according eyes Witnesses, the vehicle somersaulted four times.  Friends,
       I laid on the floor and no knowing anything again. In fact, I was gone.
       At that place I was, a had a small still voice that sounded like the voice
       of my Pastor that said, “there shall be no loss.” I opened my eyes.
       A force took set me upon my feet. The people were amazed. The people around
       held me and put me inside the vehicle carrying injured passengers. Friends,
       I lifted up my eyes and looked, I saw that lady that sat at my seat.
       Life was gone out of her. All the passengers that sat beside the window
        lost their lives. The lady died on the spot. The passerby took my sim card
        and inserted in the phone of that lady and called my family, informed them
        that the owner of the sim card got involved in an accident, and died.
        I never knew that such a thing was going on. But, when we got to the to
        the local hospital we were taken to, a lady searched my pocket and saw my
         NYSC identity card which carried my next of kin phone number. She called
         the number, and told my brother that I was involved in an accident but was
          unconscious. My brother didn’t believe her because the entire family and
          neigbours morning based on the fact that someone had told them earliar
          that I didn’t survive. My case was so critical that the local hospital
          we were had to transfer me and one other Corp Member to Jalingo Specialist
           Hospital. Two days later, the other Corp Member died. Friends, if it wasn’t
            for JESUS, I would have been in hell. JESUS, I will ever remain grateful.
            At Jalingo Specialist Hospital, the white men said that my leg will be
            amputated but my Jesus said no. If Jesus could do it for a it for a
            cultist who just accepted Him as his LORD AND SAVIOUR, He can do it for.
             What is in hell do you want? There is nothing there. I give God all the
             glory.

    <h2>POPULATING HEAVEN FOR CALVARY’S
                             SAKE
</h2>



    <h3>PRAYING CULTISTS   OUT

          OF CULT AND
         INTO CHURCH
</h3>
<h2>TESTIMONY OF RICHARD WURMBRAND</h2>
    <h3>
I was an atheist, but atheism did not give me peace to my heart…During this time of inner turmoil, an old carpenter
 in a village high up in the mountains of Romania prayed like this:” My God, I have served You on earth and I wish to
 have my reward on earth as well as in heaven. And my reward should be that I should not die before I bring a Jew to Christ, because Jesus was from the Jewish people. But I am poor, old, and sick. I cannot go around and seek a Jew. In my village there are none. Bring a Jew into my village and I will do my best to bring him to Christ.” Something irresistible drew me to that village.
I had no reason to go there. Romania has twelve thousand villages, but I went to that one. Seeing I was a Jew, the carpenter courted me as never a beautiful girl had been courted. He saw in me the answer to his prayer and gave me a Bible to read. I had read the Bible out of cultural interest many times before. But the Bible he gave me was another kind of Bible. As he told me sometime later, he and his wife prayed together for hours for my conversion and that of my wife. The Bible he gave was written not so much in words, but in flames of love fired by his prayers. I could barely read it. I could only weep over it, comparing my bad life with the life of Jesus; ...-and He accepted me as one of His own …Soon thereafter, my wife was converted. She brought other souls to Christ. Those other souls still brought still more souls to Christ…

In 1939 my wife and I accepted another pastorate and moved away. But we went to that area where we had first lived to visit
 my wife’s parents.
 We went with them to visit a neighboring farmer. He had been sickly, but they hadn’t discovered exactly what was wrong.
 They knew it was serious.
 The women were in the house. This farmer, my father-in-law, and I were sitting on the front porch, talking.
 On the inside of me, I had a burden, an agony really, to pray for this farmer. As he and my father-in-law talked, the man
  opened the door by something he said so I could move right in and say something to him about the Lord. But I didn’t.
   I held my peace. Then the conversation changed. And I never could work it around again. I said nothing to him about his
    spiritual welfare.
We spent another day or two with my wife’s folks and then came home. A couple of days later, mother-in-law called and said
this man had died.
I regretted for a while that I hadn’t followed up on the leading of the Lord and said nothing to him. Then I thought no more about it.
Sunday night, as was our custom, we met at the altar to pray 15 minutes before the service.
I stepped off the platform, knelt, and had just shut my eyes when I was in the Spirit. I saw that man. I shall never forget
it. It took me weeks to get away from it. I would wake up in the night and see it. I  saw this man in hell. I saw the fires
of hell boiling up around him. I heard his screams. I heard him cried out like the rich man did for water to cool his tongue.
Then I saw Jesus. He pointed at me and said,” I’m going to hold you responsible for him. I gave you a burden of prayer, and you didn’t pray. I opened the door for you to talk, and you didn’t talk.”
“Oh, my God! I cried. With tears, on my knees for an hour and half, I repented crying,” Oh, God. Let thing pass from me.”
I didn’t preach that night. The others didn’t know what was happening.

    <h2>THE GREAT PRIVILEGE</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>The Gospel isn’t good news until it is preached. An un-preached Gospel is useless. Carriers of the Gospel change from generation to generation, but the Gospel remains the same. Now we are here, and it is our turn to ensure that we don’t watch cultists head into hell on regular bases. I have come to realize that, every cultist is initially designed by God to proclaim the Gospel to the uttermost part of the earth. 1 Tim 1: 12-14,” And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, and counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; he found me a blasphemer, a persecutor, a hopeless sinner and granted me mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief”. It is possible to pray every cultist into the Kingdom of God by identifying their names, and engaging with the names identified in warfare to get them delivered from the demons that have blinded their mind. The Lord set me free from seven dedicated years in cultism through my mother’s intercessory prayers. My mother knew that I have missed it, but realized that the only way to break the power of the enemy was to pray. Friends, there is nobody too powerful anywhere .The Gospel is the power of God. The love that God showed to the world by given His only Son, cultists  included. The Name of Jesus is superior to the gods of Vikings, Black Axe, Buccaneers,Maffia, Burkinafaso, Clansmen, Eiye, etc. We need to engage the power of Light against the darkness that locked up the minds of those brothers and sisters out there, wondering in cultism. Col 1:12-14”Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:”
Friends, If we engage in prayer accordingly, we will be able to stop the gate of hell holding them captive. We do not need to try to evaluate how God will do it. I remember how my conversion started. Before I got delivered from cultism, one day, I had a very strange visitation, that was in 2008. An old man walked into my room while I was asleep around 1am in the morning, and said to me,” stop what you are doing, if not you will end up in miserable.” I opened my eyes, but saw something that looked like a shadow of an old man walking out of my room. The old man’s words started echoing in my ears for days, and days entered month. I will never forget what happened that night. At that time, I never had such visitation before in my life, so I became afraid. Immediately, I started ruminating on my ways. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no cultist that can be won for Christ in the energy of mere advice and counselling. Every cultist entered into a covenant with a demon sealed with blood. So, trying to win them on the arena of sweet words will amount to an effort in futility. After I had that encounter at night, the following day I went out and shared what I saw with some friends. One of them echoed, and said,” please give him one jumbo of marijuana to enable him come back to normal.” I collected the marijuana and did as occasion demanded, only to discover that the appetite was no more in me. Praise the LORD! In the evening of that day, we had a meeting which I attended. One of them looked at my face, and said,”you don’t belong here any longer.” Friends, it was the force of prayer that was at work. I saw what I have lost for involving in cultism. The following morning, for the very first time in my life, in seven years, I requested for a Bible from a friend who knew what I was involved into. He was so shocked that I could ask him for a Bible. Ladies and gentlemen, the Gospel is the power of Salvation. I didn’t give my life to Jesus then, but few months later I got saved. There is nothing good in cultism. Cultism is a sinker of destiny. Let populate heaven for Calvary’s sake. Let us not assume that they will get save someday.

    <h2>How to Pray Cultists Out of Cult And Into Church</h2>
    <h3>People often get discouraged when praying for the salvation of loved ones and begin to wonder if their prayers ever really help. Well, guess what? Yes! Your prayers can be a powerful force in the lives of your unsaved relatives and friends if you know how to pray for them according to the wisdom and Word of God.
The problem is that most Christians don’t know how to pray with skill. They just throw prayers in every direction and hope something comes of it. That’s especially true when it comes to praying for the lost. It’s not uncommon to see believers praying for friends or loved ones to get saved for 20, 30 or even 40 years without results.
What exactly are these people praying? It usually boils down to something like this: “Oh, God, please save my brother. He needs to be saved.” (Don’t you think God knows he needs saving?) Then they might go a step further and start rehearsing their brother’s sins: “Lord, he got drunk again last night and we had to bail him out of jail again. If You don’t save him, he’s going to drive us all crazy!”
That may sound funny—the example is a little extreme to make a point—but many of us have prayed prayers that sounded something like that.
What we haven’t understood is this: There’s nothing wrong with the cultists you see in the campus (or any other unsaved person) except the devil. No human being who truly understood the salvation Jesus has offered to us would reject that salvation of his own free will. No one!
Why, then, are so many people still joining cult after seeing how students are massacred regularly? II Corinthians 4:4 tells us it is because “the god of this world [the devil] hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”
Once you realize it’s the devil (not the student ) who’s the real problem, your first prayer step becomes clear. You must get the devil out of every cultist to get them saved. From my experience, and others who were once cultists, but  are serving the Lord today, every cultist is originally created by God to proclaim the Gospel.
As Jesus said, “How can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man?” (Matthew 12:29). You can’t! So bind him.
Say, “You spirit operating in the life of  this student,(-name ---------), blinding    him/her          to the gospel to keep   him/her           out of the kingdom of God, I bind you now. I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ. I carry His authority and righteousness, and in His Name I command you to desist in your maneuvers. I spoil your house according to the Word of God and I enter into it to deliver this student (mention the person’s name) one from your hands.”
Now, you may not be able to cast that devil entirely out of the situation, because the student may invite him back in faster than you can cast him out. But you can bind that spirit and keep it bound. It may keep you busy for a while, but you can do it.
You’ll find your next prayer step in Matthew 9:37-38. There, Jesus was looking out at the multitudes who needed ministry and He said to His disciples, “The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.”
It’s the Word of God that brings faith for salvation: “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17). What finally convicted and converted me was the word of God in 1Cor2 :9”  But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him”. So you need to see to it that the Word gets into the heart of these prospective kingdom brethren
“How?” you say, “These students won’t listen to me!”
Probably not, but God knows who these students will listen to, and He’ll send that person halfway around the world to talk to these students if necessary.
So pray to the Lord of the harvest: “Father, I’m asking You to send laborers across             ’s path, laborers who are equipped with the Word of God about salvation, the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, healing and deliverance. Send laborers who can communicate effectively with              so Your Word can reach his/her heart.”
Once you’ve prayed these students like that, from then on, put your faith in action by treating these  students like they are saved. Don’t treat these students like they are not good. On the contrary, every time you see them, say, “Praise God! Isn’t it good to know Jesus?” Then just stand back and watch how things change. You’ll be amazed.
It’s happened many times. And it can happen that way for you and your loved one. So don’t give up. Get smart! Start praying according to the Word and praying by faith…and you will see the salvation of the Lord!

    <h2>SAMPLE PRAYER THAT CAN ARREST ANY CULTIST FOR CHRIST</h2>
     <h4>Here is a sample prayer that can break any cultist, drive every demon out. As you speak God’s Word, remember that it will not return to Him void. It will prosper in the thing whereto it is sent (Isaiah 55:11):
“Father, I come before You in prayer and in faith, believing. Your Word says You desire all men to be saved and come into the knowledge of the truth, so I bring _______ before You this day.
“I break the power of Satan from his assignments and activities in ......... ’s life in the Name of Jesus. Now, while Satan is bound, I ask that You send forth the perfect laborers to share the good news of the gospel in such a way that
 will listen and understand it. As the truth is ministered, I believe.........will open his/her eyes to the gospel, come out of the snare of the devil and make Jesus Lord.
“Father, I ask that You fill  ........with the knowledge of Your will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. As I intercede in his/her behalf, I believe that the power of the Holy Spirit is activated, and from this moment on, I shall praise and thank You for             ’s salvation. I am confident that You are alert and active, watching over Your Word to perform it. It will not return to You void. It will accomplish that which You please and prosper in the thing whereto it was sent.
“Therefore, my confession of faith is: ‘God has begun a good work in.........’s life and He will perform it and bring it to full completion until the day of Jesus Christ, in Jesus’ Name.’
